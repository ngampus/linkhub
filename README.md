# LinkHub Deployment Architecture

This repository contains the detailed infrastructure and deployment architecture for the LinkHub application, a cloud-native, scalable, and resilient aggregator link service built using Kubernetes and related best practices.

---

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure leverages the following key open-source components and cloud-native patterns:

- **GitHub**: Source code repository.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation for build, test, and deploy pipelines.
- **Cloudflare**: Edge DNS and DDoS protection.
- **Docker & Harbor**: Containerization and secure registry management.
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package management and templating.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration platform managing stateless pods.
- **Traefik**: Dynamic ingress controller managing incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- **Bastion Host**: Secure administrative entry to cluster nodes.

The cluster and pods are deployed inside a private subnet protected by NAT Gateway and layered with security best practices.

Cluster traffic routing, auto-scaling, and zero-downtime deployments are key features supported.

---

## Key Features

### Scalability
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling enabled to dynamically adjust pod counts.
- Stateless microservices allow for efficient replication and scaling.
- Infrastructure supports seamless worker node additions for capacity.

### Reliability
- Multiple redundant pods ensure failover on individual pod failures.
- Liveness and readiness probes monitor pod health and availability.
- Load balancing via Traefik and Cloudflare to distribute client requests.

### Availability
- Kubernetes rolling updates provide zero downtime deployments.
- Multi-zone deployment potential for higher availability SLAs.
- Private subnet access restricts exposure of nodes to the internet.

### Resiliency
- Kubernetes self-healing automatically restarts malfunctioning pods.
- Use NAT Gateway and private subnet for secure egress traffic.
- Monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana enables proactive issue detection.

## Deployment Pipeline

1. Developers push code to GitHub repository.
2. Jenkins CI/CD pipeline triggers build of Docker images.
3. Built images are pushed and managed within Harbor registry.
4. Helm chart templates package application definitions per environment.
5. Helm deploys/updates applications onto Kubernetes cluster via API.
6. Traefik ingress routes external traffic dynamically to deployed pods.

---

## Security Design

- Kubernetes nodes reside solely within private networking subnet.
- Bastion host used as controlled access point for administrative tasks.
- All external traffic flows through Cloudflare, Traefik, and Load Balancer.
- Secrets management and role-based access control (RBAC) enforced on cluster.

---

## Observability

- Prometheus collects metrics from Kubernetes and application pods.
- Grafana dashboards visualize performance and health.
- Alerting setup notifies on resource exhaustion, failures, and anomalies.

---

## How to Use

- Clone the repository.
- Follow Jenkins pipeline configuration documented inside `/ci` folder.
- Customize Helm chart values for your environment.
- Deploy Helm chart to Kubernetes using standard Helm CLI commands.
- Monitor deployment using provided Grafana dashboards.
